# The code for RADIO

This repo contains the source code for the RADIO model.

## Programming language

**Pytorch** with version 1.8.0 or later

## Required libraries

0. You need to set up the environment for running the experiments (Python 3.7 or above)

1. Install **Pytorch** with version 1.8.0 or later

2. Install **torch-geometric** package with version 2.0.1

   Note that it may need to appropriately install the package `torch-geometric` based on the CUDA version (or CPU version if GPU is not available). Please refer to the official website https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html for more information on installing prerequisites.

   For example (Mac / CPU)

   ```
   pip install torch-scatter torch-sparse torch-cluster torch-spline-conv torch-geometric -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-1.9.0+cpu.html
   ```

3. Install **Deepsnap** with version 0.2.1

   ```
   pip install deepsnap
   ```

## Hardware info

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 24G GPU

Intel Xeon Platinum 8370C processor 32-core 2.8G CPU

## Datasets info
### Ethereum Blockchain

The ETH datasets are data from the Ethereum blockchain shared by Google BigQuery[1]. They contain token transactions from source to sink addresses with the transaction amount. The ETH datasets are also used in the SOTA work AntiBenford [2].

Our datasets are available on Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TOeVzgQJAYdlGhaabtGcg8WDE9e73l3z?usp=sharing 

- dataset/eth-2018jan
- dataset/eth-2019jan

Each of them contains a ground-truth subgraphs file `{name}-1.90.anomaly.txt` and an edge file `{name}-1.90.ungraph.txt`.

### Blur

The Blur dataset is a transaction dataset from the NFT marketplace [55], which is compiled by Etherscan API[3] from Oct. 19, 2022 to Apr. 1, 2023. They contain NFT transactions among addresses.

dataset/blur contains a file with abnormal subgraphs `{name}-1.90.anomaly.txt` and an edge file `{name}-1.90.ungraph.txt`.

## Data preprocessing

Consistent with AntiBenford [2], transactions valued at less than 1 unit are excluded during preprocessing. The primary step involves constructing the graph. To represent multiple transactions between two nodes, we combine them into a single edge. Each edge is associated with the transaction frequency and the financial distribution, i.e., the probabilities of transaction amounts starting with a certain digit. This resulting input graph is used for our analysis.

The edge file requires pre-processing. The following steps need to be taken:

- The pre-processing details are in /dataset/eth-2018jan/sum.py and /dataset/eth-2019jan/sum.py.

## How to run the code for RADIO

```
python run.py --dataset=eth-2019jan
```

Main arguments:

```
--dataset [eth-2019jan,eth-2018jan,blur]: the dataset to run
--n_layers: number of GNN layers
--pred_size: total number of predicted anomaly subgraphs
--agent_lr: the learning rate of Anomalous Subgraph Refinement
```

  For more argument options, please refer to `run.py`
